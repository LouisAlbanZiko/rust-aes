# AES Implementation in Rust

Implementation of the AES encryption standard as described here: [FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/197/final/docs/fips-197.pdf)


### DO NOT USE THIS IN YOUR CODE

I did this as a learning exercise.

Although I did try to follow the specification as closely as I could and I did test with the examples given, I haven't tested it extensively nor is it easy to use because I only implemented the encrypt/decrypt for blocks. You would need to implement the mode of operation yourself or use another library for it.
